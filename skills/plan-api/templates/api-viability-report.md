# API Viability Report: [API Product Name]

## Executive Summary
<!-- 2-3 sentence verdict: score, zone, go/no-go recommendation -->

## API Concept Overview
<!-- What: API description and core endpoints. Who: target developer persona. Why: developer pain point being solved. How: key technical differentiator. -->

## 5-Factor API Viability Assessment

### Factor 1: Developer Demand — Score: X/3
<!-- Evidence of developer need: Stack Overflow questions, GitHub issues, forum requests, search volume. Named existing workarounds developers use. Why this score. -->

### Factor 2: Alternatives — Score: X/3
<!-- Existing API solutions found. Gap analysis — what's missing. Competitor API comparison table. Why this score. -->

### Factor 3: Integration — Score: X/3
<!-- Adoption complexity assessment. Time-to-first-call estimate. Auth model evaluation. Developer experience comparison. Why this score. -->

### Factor 4: Monetization — Score: X/3
<!-- Pricing landscape for similar APIs. Developer willingness-to-pay evidence. Revenue model viability. Why this score. -->

### Factor 5: Maintainability — Score: X/3
<!-- Underlying data/service stability. Breaking change risk assessment. Support burden estimate. Why this score. -->

## Overall Score
<!-- DeveloperDemand × Alternatives × Integration × Monetization × Maintainability = Total. Zone classification. -->
