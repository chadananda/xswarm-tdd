# Domain: plan — Planning & Architecture
Load @domains/writing-voice.md — applies to deliverable text.
Use /plan skill for structured requirements gathering and task decomposition.
Use `feature-dev:code-architect` for architecture design — analyzes existing patterns and provides implementation blueprints.
Use `feature-dev:code-explorer` for deep codebase analysis before planning — traces execution paths, maps dependencies.
Native Tasks with DAG dependencies — fan out independent work as parallel tasks.
Restate requirements before designing — assumptions without verification waste cycles.
Check existing utilities before proposing new code — avoid reinventing what exists.
Identify smallest testable increments. Verify each before moving on.
Outer loop: acceptance test stays red across unit cycles. Inner loop: unit TDD until green.
Independent features → agent teams (parallel). Sequential tasks → subagents (pipeline).
